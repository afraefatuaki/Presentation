# Welcome to my coffeeshop landing page,

In my first weeks in the bootcamp, we had to create and design a landing page for a subject they choosed for us individually.
in my case I had to create a landing page for a coffeeshop, I used canva for the logo and some products fotos in my page to match the color palette I choosed.
the page is made with simple html/css.
